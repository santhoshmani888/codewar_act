Find the vowels

We want to know the index of the vowels in a given word, for example, there are two vowels in the word super (the second and fourth letters).

So given a string "super", we should return a list of [2, 4].

Some examples:
Mmmm  => []
Super => [2,4]
Apple => [1,5]
YoMama -> [1,2,4,6]

php:

def vowel_indices(word):
	# your code here
    
    result = []
    i = 0

    for vowel in word:
        i += 1

        if vowel.lower() in 'aeiouy':
            result.append(i)

    return result
