Find the unique number

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

Python:

def find_uniq(arr):
    # your code here
    arr.sort()

    if(arr[0] < arr[len(arr)-1] and arr[0] < arr[len(arr)-2]):
        l = arr[0]
    else:
        l = arr[len(arr)-1]
    return l
